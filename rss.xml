      <title>Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream</title>
      <link>https://martin.kleppmann.com/2025/12/08/ai-formal-verification.html</link>
      <description>A prediction that hopefully comes true. Since almost everyone adores TLA+, and yet almost nobody is capable of writing a single correct line of it, perhaps we really need to offload formal verification to AI.</description>

      <description>Good conclusions from the Cloudflare unwrap fiasco. tl;dr your production code should crash more, not less, especially if the alternative is running in a defective state. Much better to suffer from a few hours of downtime than chasing your leaked personal data in the darkest corners of the Internet.</description>

      <description>Do not get your hopes up just yet -- async Rust is not cancelled as a whole. The article dissects the asynchronous destructors problem that most async frameworks have, one way or the other. In Rust, there exists a concept of &quot;cancel safety&quot; I was not really aware of. The concrete example of mutating state under a Tokio mutex really helped me grasp the idea!</description>

      <description>At this point it&#039;s pretty much muscle memory to include samwho&#039;s newest post in the digest. This time it visualizes Big O notation for computational complexity. Perhaps not groundbreaking for computer science graduates, but really useful to explain the importance of complexity to everyone else!</description>

      <title>Optimizing our way through Metroid</title>
      <link>https://antithesis.com/blog/2025/metroid/</link>
      <description>Unique opportunity to learn fuzzers and deterministic simulation in action, while travelling back in time all the way to the GameBoy™ years. Brilliant. I also admire the genius blog rendering system where the &quot;footnotes&quot; become &quot;side notes,&quot; printed right next to the main text.</description>

      <title>Without the futex, it&#039;s futile</title>
      <link>https://h4x0r.org/futex/</link>
      <description>A thorough dissection of what futex (fast userspace mutex) is, why it is useful, and how to build other locking primitives on top of it. The article also serves as a sample and review of The Art of Multiprocessor Programming book, and was inspired by Phil Eaton&#039;s book club.</description>

      <title>We Rewrote the Ghostty GTK Application</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-gtk-rewrite</link>
      <description>Lessons learned from yet another rewrite of Ghostty terminal emulator. The most interesting bits are actually about Zig (the language), and the fact that its compiler was able to detect the vast majority of memory safety bugs. All that without being Rust!</description>

      <description>An opinionated piece on Zig&#039;s syntax choices. Inspirational, especially for people considering a new language.</description>

      <title>Anubis.</title>
      <link>https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/anubis.html</link>
      <description>This is a kind of article that makes you (or at least me) think &quot;wow, I also assumed Anubis just worked perfectly, without actually verifying it with numbers like this guy did&quot;. Brilliant, and brings up very reasonable doubts if this system actually prevents AI scraping bots from accessing the website, or maybe it just mildly annoys users with older smartphones.</description>

      <title>How Turso made connections to SQLite databases 575x faster</title>
      <link>https://turso.tech/blog/how-turso-made-connections-faster</link>
      <description>Part I: a study of a known performance bottleneck in SQLite when a database stores lots of tables. Part II: a showcase of how to elegantly fix the bottleneck and make sure opening new connections is smooooth and scales well regardless of the total number of tables stored.</description>

      <title>Resizable structs in Zig</title>
      <link>https://tristanpemble.com/resizable-structs-in-zig/</link>
      <description>A technical deep dive into Zig language features. With a clever use of metaprogramming and Zig&#039;s approach to reflection, it is possible to get something that *looks* like a variable-sized struct, even though it is not contiguous in memory. Nice to know.</description>
